Please note that the Baseline and Daily Update folders include the citation data (XML) as well as the corresponding .md5 files. Please use the .md5 file to verify the integrity of the XML.

Record counts are also included in an HTML file. We do our best to ensure that the counts in the HTML file match the counts in the XML files; however, the .md5 files should be used to check the validity of the XML.  The HTML counts are not intended for this purpose.
